Project 1: KVStore using Log-structured Merge Tree
The handout files include two main parts:

The KVStoreAPI class in kvstore_api.h that specifies the interface of KVStore.
Test files including correctness test (correctness.cc) and persistence test (persistence.cc).

First have a look at the kvstore_api.h file to check functions you need to implement. Then modify the kvstore.cc and kvstore.h files and feel free to add new class files.

We will use all files with .cc, .cpp, .cxx suffixes to build correctness and persistence tests. Thus, you can use any IDE to finish this project as long as you ensure that all C++ source files are submitted.

For the test files, of course you could modify it to debug your programs. But remember to change it back when you are testing.

Good luck :)
